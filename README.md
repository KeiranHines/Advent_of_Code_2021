# Advent_of_Code_2021

This repository contains all my solutions to the Advent of Code 2021 challenges. 

All answers are validated by a test in the file <day>_test.go. 
All inputs are in the inputs file under d<x>a where x is the day number e.g. day 5 input is in the files d5a. For example inputs, the input may either be in the Example test its
self or in a d<x>t file, where x is the day number if the example input was sufficiently large to warrant its own input file. 

To run the code with your own input copy your input into the days input file. Run the tests. The tests will then fail with the expected result for your input.
If the test doesn't fail your answer is the same as mine, what are the odds of that.
